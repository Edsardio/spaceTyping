# spaceTyping
Better Discord plugin for space typing

Adds a space after each character when the message starts with "/space" (removes /space when sending the message)

# Known bugs

- Ruins your tag (unless you can select the person with tab)
- Only works in a full screen chat (not the chats on the right side)
